				<p>DJs Music is now closed. I run this website from 2007 until 2020, for 13 years of my life.</p>
				<p>This was where I first learnt about database optimization, production code, supporting users... it was an amazing ride and an experience that jump-started my professional career later on.</p>
				<p>At its peak, DJs Music served over 3Tb of traffic every month, it had arond 20k active users, 7k songs, and millions of visits every single month.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Unfortunately, at some point in the journey Google decided that DJs Music breached the ToS of Adsense and banned the account automatically, citing copyright issues. I had always been very proactive towards copyright claims and removed any songs that received complaints (which only happened about 3 times in those 13 years). After AdSense I tried a few other ad networks but none paid nearly as much, so the website stopped generating revenue.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In any case, I'll leave this here for a little longer, since the domain is still mine. If you want to buy the domain get in touch.</p>
