				<p>I am on the process of redesigning and rebuilding the website, which is taking a lot of thinking and testing. I decided to go <a href="/technology">open-source</a>, and this is the real new version, being built live. This means that nothing will probably work as expected unfortunately. In the meantime you can access the <a href="http://djs-music.com">old version</a>.</p>
				<p>Original About section:</p>
				<blockquote>
					It's been many years now since the start of DJs Music (2007). And of course, it went through many stages until today. It all started as a music sharing blog, although it got quite popular in its first year, so we decided to make it into a full website.

				<h4>Why is this different?</h4>
				<p>Well, I'm not sure if this website adds that much value to the thousands of music sharing websites out there. At least the current user base seems to be nice and respectful to each other.</p>
