		<p>There are no predefined advertising plans. As you may have noticed we are using Google Adsense for the everyday ads, to pay for the servers and such.</p>
		<p>If you or your company are interested in advertising please get <a href="/contact">in touch</a> with us and we will work something out</p>
		<p>In the past we have had companies place banners, run email campaigns, music contest sponsorships... So whatever you have in mind can probably be done, on a budget.</p>
