> Web client for the DJs Music website running on Backbone.js and Require.js

It acts as an interface with the [DJs Music API](https://github.com/DJsMusic/DJsMusic-Client/wiki/API) *(Docs)*

We are using Grunt for the build process. You need to have Node.js installed as well.

To build run:
```
> npm install
> grunt build
```

This will generate the application in the `build` folder. If you have access to this repo you can run:
```
> grunt deploy
```
Which will commit the latest changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
